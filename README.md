# KNN-Classifier-Breast-Cancer
ðŸ§¬ KNN Classifier for Breast Cancer Detection

This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to predict whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign using the popular Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset (from sklearn.datasets).

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

  1 - Applied KNN algorithm for classification.
  
  2 - Preprocessed the dataset (feature scaling, train-test split).
  
  3 - Trained and evaluated the model with different values of k to find the best performance.
  
  4 - Measured performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

ðŸ”¹ Tools & Libraries
  
  1- Python
  
  2 - scikit-learn
  
  3 - Pandas, NumPy

  4 - Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

ðŸ”¹ Results

  1 - Achieved high accuracy in classifying tumors.

  2 - Visualized decision boundaries and performance metrics.

ðŸ”¹ Applications

  1 - Early and reliable classification of breast cancer tumors can support medical professionals in diagnosis and improve treatment outcomes.
